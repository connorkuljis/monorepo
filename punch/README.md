# Ideas for the random work sampler.

- when a user is punched in create a random work sampler
- eg 10:00 -> 15:00, take 5 random samples.

## ideas
- what information would a random work sample contain how can it be automated?
  - geolocation? 
- optional comment / rating when punching out
- preallocation > fixed calendars

### notes
- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_clock)

- You can also use the pkill command to send the signal to the ffmpeg process without needing to know its PID. This command searches for processes based on their name and arguments.

`pkill -SIGINT -f 'ffmpeg'`
