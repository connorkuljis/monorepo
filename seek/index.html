      <p>Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Technology, Digital & Engineering Graduate Program at KPMG.  As a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Computing - Software Engineering from Curtin University, I am eager to leverage my technical skills and passion for innovation in a dynamic and challenging environment.</p>
      <p>Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a strong foundation in software development, cloud computing, and cybersecurity.  I am particularly interested in applying my knowledge to real-world problems and contributing to the development of innovative solutions that have a positive impact on society.  I am particularly drawn to KPMG's commitment to diversity, inclusion, and employee well-being, as well as its focus on developing the interpersonal skills necessary for a successful corporate career.  I believe that the Graduate Program offers a unique opportunity to learn from experienced professionals, build valuable skills, and make a meaningful contribution to the team.  My experience in working on projects like the Australian Automated Document Verification Service and Block-cli has honed my abilities in problem-solving, teamwork, and communication. I am confident that I can quickly adapt to new technologies and challenges, and I am eager to learn and grow alongside a team of talented individuals. 

Thank you for your time and consideration. I am excited about the opportunity to join the KPMG team and contribute to its continued success.</p>
